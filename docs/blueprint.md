# **App Name**: Legal Clarity AI

## Core Features:

- Document Analysis: Analyze legal documents (rental agreements, loan contracts, terms of service) to identify potential risks, summarize key clauses, and provide explanations using Google's Gemini API. Summarization is powered by generative AI techniques such as sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms to condense lengthy documents into concise, understandable summaries.
- Risk Assessment: Use AI to determine whether document clauses put the user at significant disadvantage, or contain excessive obligations on the user. Apply risk scores to legal provisions, giving each one a colored risk label.
- Interactive Question Answering: Enable users to ask questions about specific clauses or sections of the document and receive clear, concise answers. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques powered by transformer-based models allow users to interact with legal documents through question answering.
- Plain Language Simplification: Translate complex legal jargon into plain language, ensuring users can easily understand the document's content. Use LLMs as a tool in a processing pipeline.
- OCR Integration: Utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from scanned legal documents, making it possible to analyze even paper-based agreements. Enhance overall data processing, supporting a wider range of legal documents, and integrate generative models for automatic text correction of the raw output.
- Document Upload and Display: Allow users to upload legal documents and view them within the app.
- Summarization Export: Allow users to export the analysis results in formats like PDF.
